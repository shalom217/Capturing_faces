This model helps us in capturing faces from a video file or by an external camera source.
During any emergency situation for example when a crime/robbery/riots happened and we have CCTV installed in those areas so the next thing we can do is to check all those videos one by one from each of the CCTV.
After watching those videos then we can only come to know a) How many people involved, b) Who is/are involved, then next step is to
find those people.
For this process we must have a dedicated group of personnel or a team to watch those videos carefully from starting to till the end to find/recognise the people appearing in that CCTV footages.
AI enables us to capture the faces appeared in the footage automatically and removes the need of dedicated group of people to watch those video.
Just upload the video on Tkinter based API and let the video play, after the end of video it will display the no. of people and saves all the faces appeared in that video file in a directory.
Live face capturing option is also available.
System uses Tkinter, Open Cv, Python 3.7 or higher.
